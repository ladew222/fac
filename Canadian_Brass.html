			  <p> <!-- Temp name="Note" -->Dear Arts Supporters,</p>
			  <p>On behalf of everyone at ­Viterbo University, I would like to welcome you to the Fine Arts Center as we celebrate the return of in-person performances. The pandemic necessitated a year and a half-long pause in our live event schedule, and both our artists and audience members have been sorely missed. It is truly great to have you with us.</p>
			  <p>It’s only fitting that the Fine Arts Center should be fully used to its intended purpose during its 50th anniversary year. Opened in 1971, it remains not only the premier arts facility in the region, but also a wonderful testament to the vision and courage of the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration who made it possible. Their collective love and appreciation for the arts led to countless cultural opportunities in the greater La Crosse community and has enhanced all our lives.</p>
			  <p>New Fine Arts Center director Dillion McArdle and his staff have an outstanding season planned for you this year. I invite you to pick up an On Stage book or visit the Viterbo website for the complete schedule. There is a wide variety of offerings from which to choose, and tickets make wonderful gifts. Included in the schedule are the Conservatory for the Performing Arts student productions. I am continually amazed at the incredible talent of our students, and seeing them put it to use always fills me with pride, no matter their role, pursuit, or field of study.</p>
			  <p>While live performances and other events have returned, we must remain vigilant in the fight against the spread of COVID-19. I ask that you adhere to the university’s safety policies, including remaining masked while anywhere inside the building.</p>
			  <p>The arts will always be an integral part of the Viterbo University experience, which is made even more special through the support of our patrons, benefactors, sponsors, and volunteers. It would not be the same without you. Thank you.</p>

            <p><!-- Temp name="BioText" -->With an international reputation as one of the most popular brass ensembles today, Canadian Brass has truly earned the distinction of “the world’s most famous brass group."</p>
			<p>Friends Chuck Daellenbach and Gene Watts first came together in 1970 to form a brass quintet—a chamber music setting not entirely new, but never before having garnered the success and storied career Canadian Brass would achieve over the next 40 years. Initially, Watts took on the role of developing new repertoire while Daellenbach was the moving force in marketing, publishing, and managing the business. Three empty chairs were quickly filled and together, the group’s imagination and consummate musicianship elevated the art of the brass quintet to what it is today. Here was not only an opportunity to explore the possibilities of an all-brass chamber group but a challenge to bring the sound and the excitement of brass music to new audiences.</p>
			<p>Masters of concert presentations, Canadian Brass has developed a uniquely engaging stage presence and rapport with audiences. Each of their concerts will show the full range from trademark Baroque and Dixieland tunes to new compositions and arrangements created especially for them–from formal classical presentation to music served up with lively dialogue and theatrical effects. The hallmark of any Canadian Brass performance is entertainment, spontaneity, virtuosity, and, most of all, fun–but never at the expense of the music. Whatever the style, the music is central and performed with utmost dedication, skill, and excellence.</p>
			<p>With a discography of over 130 albums and an extensive world-wide touring schedule, Canadian Brass is an important pioneer in bringing brass music to mass audiences everywhere. They have sold well over two million albums worldwide, with 1.2 million sold in the Nielsen Soundscan era alone (since 1991). They continue to score <em>Billboard</em> chart positions—like with their rousing recording of patriotic songs and marches, <em>Stars & Stripes: Canadian Brass Salute America</em>, which spent eight weeks in the Top 25 on the <em>Billboard</em> Classical Chart, peaking at number two! Touring legends with an enthusiastic fan base, the Canadian Brass play to packed houses everywhere throughout the U.S., Canada, Japan, and Europe. They have also toured Australia, the Middle East, the Soviet Union and South America. They were the first brass ensemble from the West to perform in the People’s Republic of China (where they returned for a five-city tour to great acclaim in the spring of 2010 and several visits after this, including an appearance on Hunan TV for Chinese New Year) as well as the first brass group to take the main stage at the venerable Carnegie Hall. On numerous occasions Canadian Brass has been invited by the Canadian Government to play for visiting heads of states, becoming one of Canada’s greatest resources and musical ambassadors.</p>
			<p>Education plays a key role in the story of Canadian Brass and each member is uniquely attuned to training the next generation of players. On their travels around the world, they often pause for masterclasses and are more than happy to work with students and young audiences. Canadian Brass was Ensemble in Residence at the University of Toronto after having been Chamber Quintet-in-Residence for many years at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, Calif., and has created an innovative brass summer course at the Eastman School of Music. Their support of education is also clearly viewed in their outreach and interaction with El Sistema, the acclaimed global music education program in Venezuela.</p>
			<p>In conjunction with the Hal Leonard Corporation, Canadian Brass has made available their extensive library of brass music for performers of all levels as well as learning tools. Since 1998 Canadian Brass has been a recording artist at Opening Day Entertainment Group (ODEG) (distributed by IDLA) releasing over 25 CDs on the imprint to date. Opening Day is owned and run by Daellenbach together with his wife, MB. Canadian Brass sheet music and recordings are available in their online store.</p>
			<p>With four decades under their belts, Canadian Brass continues to thrill audiences around the world–and they don’t look like they are letting up anytime soon!</p>
			<p>Canadian Brass is: founding member Chuck Daellenbach (tuba), James Vaughen and Caleb Hudson (trumpets), Achilles Liarmakopoulos (trombone), and Jeff Nelsen (horn). Canadian Brass is represented by IMG Artists in New York.

            <p><!-- Temp name="BioText" --><h5>Chuck Daellenbach</h5>
              has brought music, imagination, and humour to Canadian Brass since the group was formed in 1970. Playing a key role in all of the group’s groundbreaking projects, world travels, and on over 130 recordings, Daellenbach and his gold-plated and carbon bell tuba are the bedrock of the massive Canadian Brass repertoire–from Baroque to jazz. Daellenbach comes from a long line of German and Swiss musicians and, during his upbringing in Wisconsin, his father gave him daily music lessons. </p>
			<p>As a teenager, Daellenbach began studies with legendary Chicago Symphony tuba player, Arnold Jacobs, and throughout his career whenever possible would stop in to see his mentor, Mr. Jacobs. After earning a PhD at the age of 25 from the Eastman School of Music, Daellenbach headed north to teach as music faculty at the University of Toronto. His academic plans were soon derailed when he met trombonist Gene Watts. Together they formed this unique brass quintet with Daellenbach on tuba.</p>
			<p>For the next 38 years Watts and Daellenbach guided Canadian Brass to the top of their field, through thousands of performances and fantastic opportunities including two “command” performances for the Queen of England. Daellenbach’s dialogue during concerts has kept audiences engaged helping to establish an appreciation for great music of all types to musicians and non-musicians alike. Possibly the most recognized tuba player in the world, Daellenbach has performed with many of the greatest musicians and conductors.</p>
			<p>The definition of a multi-tasker, Daellenbach always has several projects in the works at once. These include a series of hundreds of brass works published by Hal Leonard (many accompanied by CDs) played by music students and professional players around the world. He runs Canadian Brass Publishing and together with his wife, MB, they manage Opening Day Entertainment Group [Odeg],the ensemble's recording label. They reside in Toronto, with their sons, Chris and Willis.
