    <p><!-- Temp name="BioText" --> <h5>7 Bridges: The Ultimate EAGLES Experience</h5> is a stunningly accurate tribute to the music of the Eagles. Using no backing tracks or harmonizers, 7 Bridges faithfully re-creates the experience of an Eagles concert from the band’s most prolific period. </p>
	
	<p> Every show features one brilliant hit single after another with some mighty Don Henley, Joe Walsh, and Glenn Frey solo surprises sprinkled into the mix. 7 Bridges offers the perfect blend of songs to capture all levels of Eagles devotees. </p>
		
		
	<p>7 Bridges is a tour de force of talent, combining incredible musicianship, vocal precision, and a stage presence that has garnered them nationwide acclaim. The band features Jay Sweet as Glenn Frey, Keith Thoma as Don Henley, James Richardson as Randy Meisner/Timothy B. Schmit, Richie Scholl as the eccentric and unpredictable Joe Walsh, Brian Franklin as guitar wizard Don Felder, and Vernon Roop as Joe Vitale, the often unsung hero of many Eagles studio albums and live performances. </p>
		
<p>		For years, 7 Bridges: The Ultimate EAGLES Experience has been the ‘go to’ choice for corporate, fair/festival, casino, and private events. 7 Bridges provides an all ages, family friendly show weaved into a powerful rock-n-roll concert experience. The perfect entertainment package! <!-- Temp End--></p>

    <p><!-- Temp name="BioText" --><h5></h5> Sweet was born and raised in the small town of Mullica Hill, N.J. Even at a young age, he remembers becoming acquainted with Eagles music from his parents' <em>Hell Freezes Over</em> album. In fact, <em>Hotel California</em> was one of the first songs he ever learned on guitar when he picked up the hobby at age 15. </p> 
		  
	<p> He has been studying vocal performance since age 14 and, as a member of various prestigious choral groups, has performed at Carnegie Hall, sung the national anthem for the Philadelphia Phillies, and had the great honor of singing the hymns for afternoon Mass at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. </p>
		  
		  <p> Sweet attended Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. where he joined the Rutgers University Glee Club–one of the most prestigious male choirs in the country. After graduating from Rutgers University in 2013, he moved to Nashville to start the next chapter of his music career. </p>
			  
			  <p> Since then, he has been writing songs and working full-time as a singer and guitar player in downtown Nashville. His musical influences include James Taylor, The Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, and of course The Eagles. When he is not on tour with 7 Bridges or playing at a honky–tonk on Broadway, he can be seen at a local songwriters’ round or enjoying some of the other great bands that Nashville has to offer. <!-- Temp End--></p>

    <p><!-- Temp name="BioText" --><h5></h5> Thoma is a founding member of 7 Bridges: The Ultimate EAGLES Experience, having performed in the band since its inception in 2009. </p> 
	  
	  <p>Born and raised in LeClaire, Iowa, Keith began his musical career very early on in life. At age 2, he was already banging out beats on his mother’s cookware and other suitable objects. Throughout his formative years, Keith performed in a variety of musical groups including his high school’s jazz ensemble, marching band, and concert band. He joined country duo, The Truesdells, in 1995, with whom he opened for both Merle Haggard and Daryle Singletary. </p>
		  
		<p>  In 1997, Thoma took a departure from country music to explore the classic/modern rock genre with local act, Chunkster. He remained with the group for five years. During those years, he added vocals to his list of talents. </p>
			
			<p> From 2002 until 2004, Thoma toured the U.S. extensively with Lonesome Road. During his time with them, he performed on many stages across the U.S. including the Longbranch Saloon in Raleigh, N.C. He also played drums, percussion, and sang lead and harmony vocals on the Lonesome Road album, <em>Damn Good</em>. In addition, Thoma wrote and arranged most of the harmonies for the album. After his stint with Lonesome Road, Thoma toured briefly with Nashville Star season three finalist David St. Romain, before finally making the move to Nashville. </p>
	  
	  <p>Since his move to Music City, Thoma has toured England with Billy Yates and Sean Patrick McGraw, toured Germany with Tim McDonald, and performed at every honky-tonk in town. He now resides in Nashville with his wife, Keri. <!-- Temp End--></p>

    <p><!-- Temp name="BioText" --><h5> </h5> Richardson grew up in Milford, Mich., a village west of Detroit. He began singing three-part harmony and playing acoustic music in a folk and bluegrass trio with his twin brother, Shaun, and his cousin, Carmen. They were known as Cats and the Fiddler and entertained throughout the Midwest for nearly 15 years. Growing up, he remembers being introduced to the discography of the Eagles by his Uncle Vince at summer family get-togethers. </p>
	
<p>As a teenager, Richardson began to fall in love with jazz harmony and vocal improvisation. Obtaining a bachelor’s in jazz studies at Western Michigan University, he has immense experience as a multi-talented vocalist, performing with notable artists Deborah Brown, Randy Brecker, Chico Pinheiro, and Ben Folds (of Ben Folds Five) with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.  </p>
	
<p>Moreover, his vocal jazz stylings have been recognized by <em>Downbeat Magazine</em> in 2016 and 2017 and the Nashville Industry Music Awards (NIMA) in 2020. In 2019, Richardson joined Nashville’s cutting-edge contemporary choral group, SONUS, featured alongside Audrey Assad and Dave Barnes at the historic Ryman Auditorium.</p>
	
<p>When Richardson is not on the road, he loves to arrange and publish a cappella vocal arrangements from a wide variety of jazz, pop, and choral music. Renowned British composer Jacob Collier has lauded Richardson as “inventive and agile,” and American voice actor Gabe Kunda as “fresh ear-candy.” They are just two of the musicians that have noticed his unique ear for adventurous vocal harmony.</p>
	
<p>Richardson is poised to become one of 2022’s in-demand young musicians who New York Voices founder Peter Eldridge describes as “one of those rare people who has it all going on-talent beyond measure, a uniquely compelling vocal sound, [and] an openness and creativity weaving through his singing and songwriting.”

His brother, Paul Jr., is a world-renowned pedal steel guitarist and his dad, Paul Sr., designed Franklin Steel guitars. He began guitar lessons at the age of 13, and has been on tour with various bands and artists since graduating high school at 17.</p>

<p> Some of the acts he has traveled with include: The Kendalls, Mark Collie, Shenandoah, Alan Jackson and, most recently, Franklin spent 17 years as lead guitarist backing up “The Gambler” Kenny Rogers.</p>

<p> He is thankful for all that music has brought to his life, and feels that he has “been blessed to be able to make a living playing music while seeing much of the world, performing alongside many talented musicians, singers, and drummers.” He now enjoys touring with 7 Bridges, whom he describes as a “fun and talented group of guys.” </p>

<p> When he's not on tour with 7 Bridges, Franklin enjoys spending quality time with his wife, Rosie, and son, Noah.</p>

<p> Also, as a natural athlete, Franklin thinks fitness is important. Therefore, he tries to find time to keep his tetherball, air hockey, and hopscotch skills sharp, along with carrying his guitar rig to shows and recording sessions. (He’s also the jokester of the band!)

    <p><!-- Temp name="BioText" --><h5> </h5> Scholl was born and raised in the cattle, coal, and rail town of Rockhampton, in Queensland, Australia, and started playing bars and clubs, literally a few months after first picking up a guitar at age 13. Scholl’s live shows are a testament to the years spent “paying his dues” in front of a live crowd. Although it wasn’t long before he was writing his own music, and eventually released his first album of completely original music in 2002.</p>

<p> It wasn’t until meeting with well-respected Australian producer Michael Flanders in early 2006, however, that things started happening for Scholl. Work was scheduled to begin on a second album, <em>The Blacktop Junkie’s Guide to Richie Scholl</em> almost immediately. This album resulted in #1, and #5 singles on country radio, and a #35 video on CMC Australia. During the recording of the album, the decision was made to introduce Scholl and his music to the U.S market. After a brief trip to Nashville in 2006 to meet with labels and industry people, he relocated to Nashville in early 2007.</p>

<p> Soon after landing in town, Scholl’s musical abilities were noticed. He soon found himself on tour with national acts like Jason Michael Carroll, and Chuck Wicks. While on the road, Richie started writing material for what would become his third album, <em>One Step at a Time</em>, which was released January 2011. In 2013, he released two singles and videos, <em>Good Goodbye</em>, and <em>Last Song</em>. His latest full length album, <em>Southern </em>was released in January 2017. </p>
